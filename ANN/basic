The Perceptron and ANN Architecture

The perceptron is the fundamental building block of artificial neural networks (ANNs). 
It was introduced by Frank Rosenblatt in 1958 and is essentially a binary classifier that maps input features 
to an output decision using a simple mathematical function. A perceptron takes multiple input values, multiplies 
them by corresponding weights, adds a bias, and then passes the result through an activation function (typically a 
step function in the original version).

Mathematically, the perceptron output 
y=  f( i=1‚àën wixi + b)

ùë•ùëñ are input features,
ùë§ùëñ are weights,
ùëè is the bias term,
ùëìis the activation function.

While a single perceptron can only classify linearly separable data, this limitation was overcome with the introduction of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), which consist of multiple layers of perceptrons.
A typical ANN architecture includes:
Input layer: Receives the raw data (e.g., image pixels).
Hidden layer(s): One or more layers where computations happen. These layers use activation functions like ReLU, sigmoid, or tanh to capture complex, non-linear patterns.
Output layer: Produces the final prediction (e.g., class probabilities).
Each neuron in a hidden layer is connected to all neurons in the previous and next layers (a fully connected or dense network). Through training (typically using backpropagation and gradient descent), the network adjusts its weights to minimize the prediction error.
ANNs are powerful because they can approximate almost any function given sufficient data and layers, which is why they are widely used in image recognition, natural language processing, and other AI fields.

Geometric View of the Perceptron and ANN Architecture
 1. Perceptron (Single Neuron):
Geometrically, a perceptron defines a decision boundary (a hyperplane) in an n-dimensional input space.

For 2D input, this boundary is a line.

For 3D input, it‚Äôs a plane.

For higher dimensions, it becomes a hyperplane.

The perceptron learns the orientation and position of this hyperplane (by adjusting weights and bias) to separate different classes.

Example:
If you have two classes of points (say red and blue) in a 2D space, the perceptron will try to find a line that separates red from blue.


This is the equation of the hyperplane. All points on this line/hyperplane give a zero output after the linear combination.
 2. ANN (Multi-layer Network):
In an ANN, multiple perceptrons are stacked together in layers.

The first layer projects the input into a new space.

The hidden layers apply non-linear transformations, enabling the network to bend and curve the decision boundaries.

The final layer outputs predictions.

Geometrically, each hidden layer reshapes the data step by step, turning non-linearly separable data into linearly separable forms in higher-dimensional space.


Think of the input space as a sheet of paper.

A single perceptron draws a straight line.

A multi-layer ANN folds and stretches the paper in complex ways so that the two classes become separable.
